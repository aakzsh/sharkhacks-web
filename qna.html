    <p class="left">What can you report?</p>
    <p class="right">If you live around the coastline, or even if you have a river, lake or pond around the place you live, saverine counts on you! If you ever see corporations, people, or maybe any one who is potentially harming the aquatic life, you can report to us! They could be harming the aquatic life in a number of ways, including throwing garbage in water, throwing untreated industrial waste, hunting animals that are declared illegal to be hunt down, and more.</p>

    <p class="left">How to report?</p>
    <p class="right">The mobile app has a very clean and self explanatory UI. You need to raise a new report, which is a 3 step process. Therein, you need to enter the title of the issue, the description, attach any proof images if present, select location, and verify yourself as a human using the OTP that'll be sent on your mobile phones. After successfully verifying the OTP, your report will be saved in our database and we'll make sure it gets heard.</p>

    <p class="left">What to expect?</p>
    <p class="right">We just connect people to organisations working to help out marine life. So, whenever you'll submit a report, we will try our best to make it heard, to send it to organisations based on location and the severity of issue. You can also view the status of your report in the app itself. Although we try our best to reach out to higher authorities with the reports, it is sometimes really time taking, so your patience would be appreciated</p>
